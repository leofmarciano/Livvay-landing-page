# Codex Project Rules

You are working in the Livvay marketing site repo.

## Read First
- Always read `AGENTS.md` before making changes.
- Follow the Supabase Design System docs linked there.

## Code Style
- TypeScript, Next.js App Router, TailwindCSS.
- Keep components small and reusable in `src/components`.
- Prefer server components unless interactivity is needed.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons and `framer-motion` sparingly.

## Product + Compliance
- "Vida eterna" is ambition, never a literal promise.
- Avoid claims like "garantido", "cura", "reverte idade", "imortalidade comprovada", "milagre".
- Mention medical responsibility when referencing doctors/prescriptions.
- Any health estimates are probabilistic, not diagnostic.

## Forms + Data
- Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` with accessible labels.
- Lead capture goes through `/api/lead`.

## UX
- Mobile-first, high contrast, clear focus states.
- Keep copy short; add a practical example with feature claims.
